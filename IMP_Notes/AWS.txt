Launch Templates --> For deploying the same servers.
    source: AWS-B28, Video12.
    This is used for deploying servers only. This can't be used for creaating any other resource in AWS. 
   usage: Create a launch template for creating a server and use the same template id in AWS cloudShell console and run the for loop for deploying 3 servers. 
   
Spot Instances vs on demand Instances. 

It's recommended for K8s lab. As soon as on demand get the demand then immediately it terminqee


########################  EBS  ################################

for diskmgmt commands: teluguitfactory(disk mgmt in linux course).

lsblk
fdisk ---> crate partiotion from disk
    n -> new partiotion 
    p -> primary partiotion
    go with default values
    finally enter w --> write the changes
    then create file system:
        mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1  --> Make partition (ext4/xfs)
        press lsblk
        create a folder named /ebsvol then mount newly created partiotion to this dir. 
        press lsblk.
        But these changes are not perminant, once we reboot/shtdown the machine these changes will go off. To make this persistant update the changes in fstab.
        /etc/fstab
        after the entering the entry in the fstab file then run command 'mount -a'. It's refresh all the mount points. 
        For every reboot demon will look for fstab file and will mount the mount points as defined in fstab file. 
        
        If we extend the EBS volume , then it won't reflect immediately in lsblk. To effect the changes 
        growpart /dev/xvdf 1 ---> for extending the partiotion. 
        also file system shoud get these changes, then run 'resize2fs /dev/xvdf1'. 


############ Security  ############################

NSG is works as Firewall. 

But need to find the vulnerabilities in application and OS level. These has to be sorted out, first deploy a VM and scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. 
Then create a AMI from this then deploy VMs from this AMI when ever we need. 

AWS inspector is the one the tool offered by AWS. 

Here we can create a policies and scanning rules against machines and give a name for this. 

once we run the scan. we will get the report, it contains all the vulnerabilities 


##########################  AMI Images  ################################

AMI custom images can be created using packer. 
All listed images in default view are carrying with many vulnerabilities, it leads to significant risk. to mitigate this issue, we have to remediate them before deploy.
usually this mitigation can be accomplish through ansible. 

vulnerabilities are caught through scanners such as Qualys, Nexus, Nexpose ,AWS inspector. 
After mitigating all the vulnerabilities, reboot the machine, then again initiate the scan. we haveto repeat this process untill it become zero vulnerabilities.
later generate AMI from this VM. so that upcoming deployments from this image will have minimal vulnerabilities. 

###################### Snapshots  ##########################################

It's a backup for EBS volume. AMI are consider as root volume backups. 

If we attach 10Gb EBS volume to any server, and keep adding some files to it. Then if we take snapshot, then it's resultant size would be 10gb. 
Later we add few more files to it, then 2nd snapshot conatains all files( files from 1st snap and 2nd). 
Later we add few more files to it, then 3nd snapshot conatains all files( files from 1st snap, 2nd and 3rd).

At any moment if we would like to restore the volume, then we can take latest snapshot. It covers all the files. 

But now if we delete somefiles then we have taken snapshot4. 
Also added few files then taken snapshot5. 

In this case, if we would like to restore all the files then. we have to restore the snapshot5 and snapshot3 to recover all the files.
